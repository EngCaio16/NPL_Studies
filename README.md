### **NPL_Studies**  
This repository explores **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques applied to **text classification**, focusing on **sentiment analysis** and **topic modeling**.  

### **Main Features:**  

#### üìù **Sentiment Analysis (Amazon Product Reviews)**  
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF and word embeddings.  
- **Binary Classification:** Positive vs. negative sentiment classification.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.  


#### üì∞ **Topic Modeling (DOJ Press Releases: 2009‚Äì2018)**  
- **Dataset:** Department of Justice press releases from **2009 to 2018**, covering criminal justice cases.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:**  
  - **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for probabilistic topic generation.  
  - **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** for alternative topic extraction.  
- **Identified Topics:**  
  - Law enforcement and federal crimes  
  - Financial fraud and tax evasion  
  - Civil rights violations  
  - Organized crime and violent offenses  
  - Environmental regulations  
- **Visualization:** Topic distributions to interpret model results.  

This project serves as a **comprehensive study of NLP applications**, covering both **supervised learning (sentiment analysis)** and **unsupervised learning (topic modeling for crime-related news analysis)**. üöÄ
