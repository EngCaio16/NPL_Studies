        "Welcome to my text classification notebook! In this project, I worked with the Amazon Reviews dataset, which contains over 1.4 million reviews from Amazon products scraped between May 1996 and October 2018. My goal was to build a model that classifies the sentiment of these reviews as positive or negative. Using text vectorization to convert the reviews into numerical data and LinearSVC as the classifier, I achieved an accuracy of 92%. This shows a strong performance in distinguishing between sentiments based on the 'Reviews' and 'Rating' columns. Check out the steps, code, and results in the sections below!\n",
